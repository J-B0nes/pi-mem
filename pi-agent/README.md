> **Fork & adaptation of [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)** (55k+ stars, 4.4k+ forks) — the most popular persistent memory system for AI coding agents — now available as a native pi-mono extension.

Gives pi-coding-agent and any pi-mono-based runtime cross-session, cross-engine memory by connecting to claude-mem's battle-tested worker service. Same compressed memory, same hybrid search (FTS5 + Chroma vector embeddings), same cross-engine sharing — built for pi-agents.

## Why pi-agent-memory?

- **Backed by claude-mem** — the #1 memory system for AI coding agents, trusted by 55k+ developers
- **Cross-engine memory** — your pi-agent shares memory with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenClaw sessions
- **Hybrid search** — FTS5 full-text + Chroma vector embeddings for precise memory recall
- **Zero config** — installs with one command, auto-connects to the claude-mem worker
- **Battle-tested** — built on the same worker API powering thousands of daily sessions

## Installation

Requires the claude-mem worker running on `localhost:37701`. Install claude-mem first via `npx claude-mem install` or run the worker from source.

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-agent-memory
```

### From git

```bash
pi install git:github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem
```

### Manual

```bash
cp extensions/pi-mem.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-mem.ts
```

### Verify

```bash
# Start pi — the extension auto-loads
pi

# Check connectivity
/memory-status
```

## What is New

### v0.3.5 - Loop Prevention & Debug Logging
- ✨ **Loop Prevention** - Max 10 context injections per session prevents infinite loops
- ✨ **Duplicate Detection** - Hash-based deduplication skips identical context
- ✨ **Debug Logging** - Enable with `PI_MEM_DEBUG=1` for full visibility
- ✨ **Connection Info** - Shows worker URL on startup
- ✨ **Enhanced Error Handling** - Better null checks and error messages
- ✨ **Port Flexibility** - `CLAUDE_MEM_WORKER_PORT` environment variable support

## What It Does

- **Captures observations** — every tool call your pi-agent makes is recorded to claude-mem's database
- **Injects context** — relevant past observations are automatically injected into the LLM context each turn
- **Memory search** — a `memory_recall` tool is registered for the LLM to explicitly search past work
- **Cross-engine sharing** — pi-agent observations live alongside Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenClaw memories in the same database

## Event Mapping

| Pi-Mono Event | Worker API | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `session_start` | — (local state only) | Derive project name, generate session ID |
| `before_agent_start` | `POST /api/sessions/init` | Capture user prompt for privacy filtering |
| `context` | `GET /api/context/inject` | Inject past observations into LLM context |
| `tool_result` | `POST /api/sessions/observations` | Record what tools did (fire-and-forget) |
| `agent_end` | `POST /api/sessions/summarize` + `complete` | AI-compress the session |
| `session_compact` | — | Preserve session ID across context compaction |
| `session_shutdown` | — | Clean up local state |

Derived from the OpenClaw plugin (`claude-mem/openclaw/src/index.ts`), which is a proven integration of claude-mem into a pi-mono-based runtime.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_MEM_DEBUG` | `0` | Enable debug logging (`1`) |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_WORKER_PORT` | — | Worker port (overrides CLAUDE_MEM_PORT) |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_PORT` | `37701 (default for uid 501)` | Worker service port |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Worker service host |
| `PI_MEM_PROJECT` | (derived from cwd) | Project name for scoping observations |
| `PI_MEM_DISABLED` | — | Set to `1` to disable the extension |

## Cross-Engine Memory

All engines write to the same `~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db`, tagged by `platform_source`:

| Engine | Platform Source |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude` |
| OpenClaw | `openclaw` |
| Pi-Agent | `pi-agent` |
| Cursor | `cursor` |
| Codex | `codex` |

Context injection returns observations from all engines for the same project by default. Pass `platformSource` to filter by engine.
